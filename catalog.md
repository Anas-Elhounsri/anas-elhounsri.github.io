| P021 | codemeta.json | Identifier is a name instead of a valid unique identifier even though one exist (e.g., in a DOI badge, CRAN badge) | Using a name instead of a valid unique identifier in identifier, despite an existing DOI or other PID, weakens metadata integrity and disrupts citation and discovery workflows. | https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyrannosaurus | High |
| P022 | codemeta.json | The whole file is a template, it has no information | A codemeta.json containing only placeholder or template values provides no meaningful metadata and misleads users or tools expecting accurate project descriptions. | https://github.com/vliz-be-opsci/open-code-tracking | Medium |
| P023 | codemeta.json | Identifier is empty | The identififer section is mentioned but it contains empty string "". An empty identifier field in codemeta.json omits crucial metadata for persistent referencing, making the software harder to cite, index, or track, and it can hinder automated tools. | https://github.com/JorenSix/Panako | Medium |
